My personal website. An [MIT](https://github.com/mldAbdala/personal-site/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed, simple, easily modifiable application. Built using modern javascript, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), SCSS, [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and many other useful technologies.
