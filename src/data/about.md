# Intro

I am your run-of-the-mill computer science geek, I love technology, code, computers, networks and most of all **I love documentation** ... and I also like people. 
I constantly try to balance all aspects of my personality, in order to be as bland and neutral as possible, but I do have a natural tendency to chaos (genetics?).

# Currently

I am currently working with BL Harbert in the construction of a new consulate building in my home town of Hermosillo. I am in charge of their local branch of operations regarding IT and infrastructure. 

I 'm looking for opportunities in full-stack web development and learning new technologies with a new collaboration team. 

# Some history

My mother bought our first computer when I was only 10 y.o. (a 486 MS-DOS machine) along with some bright yellow and red 5 1/4' floppy disks. That red disk turned out to be a copy of doom which I managed to run after several weeks of trying.

At 18 I went to college to pursue a degree in architecture but dropped out after only two years. The next year I fell in love with Python programming after years of an abusive relationship with Java and decided to pursue a degree in CS. Life has been good ever since. 



# I like

- Cooking, grilling and frying everything under the sun. 
- Reading technical jargon.
- Collecting whiskey.

# Culture / Geography

- I've had the pleasure of working with people from all over the world. 
- I consider myself as a cosmopolitan of sorts. 
- Nevertheless, Hermosillo is the best place in the world! (probably).
